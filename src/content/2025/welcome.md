Welcome to the first Sitecore Community Advent Calendar!

Each day from December 1 through December 25 I will post a new blog post on the site. We've got posts from 25 Sitecore enthusiasts from different countries and Sitecore partners around the globe. With topics ranging from content strategy to custom Sitecore Marketplace apps to making the most of Sitecore Search, there's sure to be a post for everyone!

This project is inspired by [sysadvent](https://sysadvent.blogspot.com/), a blog advent calendar for system administrators. In college, I was a system administrator for a biochemistry lab and I looked forward to [sysadvent](https://sysadvent.blogspot.com/) every December. This year I set out to give the same gift to the Sitecore community.

Whether you celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Yule, or nothing at all in December, I hope that the Sitecore Community Advent Calendar brings you lots of joy and cheer! Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, Happy Kwanzaa, and Happy Yule to you and yours this holiday season! 🎅🎄

If you are interested in participating in the 2026 Sitecore Community Advent Calendar or want to share your thoughts about this project, please drop me a line on the [Sitecore Slack at @sitecorey](https://www.sitecore.chat) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithdev/). I would love to hear from you!
