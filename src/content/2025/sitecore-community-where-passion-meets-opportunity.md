## Welcome to the Sitecore Community

During the summer 2006 I was asked by a small Hungarian digital agency to find the best Microsoft based CMS they could offer to their customers to build websites. It was a 3-month project, and I was comparing all the available solutions out there. When I narrowed the list down to the three best options, I had three important criteria to choose the right one:

1. It should offer all the functionality a **customer** would need, and it should have a robust roadmap for the future.
2. As I used to be a **developer**, I knew how important it is to have a system which is developer friendly, which is based on standards and offers a great API.
3. The **agency** needed a partner not just a license to be sold, so finding a vendor which can provide that was key.

**Sitecore was, and still is even today, the best choice for all the above, but at that time I did not know or calculate with Sitecore’s superpower: the Community.**

The Sitecore Community today is a global network of more than 30,000 passionate people. Developers, marketers, strategists, and enthusiasts come together to share, learn, and build something bigger than themselves. This community is open to everyone, and every contribution makes a difference.

## What Makes the Sitecore Community Special?

The Sitecore Community is a movement. They organize user groups, hackathons, and social events. They create thousands of blogs, podcasts, videos, and open-source projects every year.

**Whether you are technical or strategic, new or experienced, you will find your place here.**

What truly sets the Sitecore Community apart is the spirit of collaboration and generosity. People from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and even competing companies come together, united by a shared passion. They help each other succeed, celebrate each other’s milestones, and create lifelong friendships.

## The MVP Program: Celebrating Excellence

At the heart of the community are the Sitecore MVPs. These are the top 1% of contributors who go above and beyond to share knowledge, inspire others, and drive innovation. The MVP Program recognizes these outstanding people and gives them unique opportunities for growth, learning, and connection. The real reward, though, is the impact they make and the friendships they build along the way.

Sitecore is incredibly lucky to have such a remarkable group of MVPs. These are selfless, hardworking people who dedicate their own time and resources to make the Sitecore Community bigger, better, and more welcoming for everyone. Their passion and generosity are the foundation of the community’s success. Their stories are a constant source of inspiration. If you want to hear their journeys, challenges, and triumphs, listen to the [MVP Podcast](https://mvp.sitecore.com/Podcast). Each episode is just five to ten minutes and is full of insights and motivation from community heroes.
